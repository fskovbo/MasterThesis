\chapter{Tensor Network Algorithms}
Although matrix product states enables analytical treatment of certain classes of quantum states \cite{Baxter1968,Affleck1987}, their real power becomes evident when performing numerical computations. These computations require algorithms capable of exploiting the properties of the matrix product states. The Density-Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) was developed as the most powerful numerical method to study one-dimensional quantum lattice systems \cite{White1992,White1993}. Years later the connection between the DMRG method and matrix product states was made, as these two approaches share many features \cite{Ostlund1995, Dukelsky1998}. Formulating the DMRG method in the MPS language made several extensions to the algorithm possible, which would otherwise have been very difficult to express within the DMRG framework \cite{schollwock}. Among these extensions one finds the tDMRG algorithm \cite{Vidal2003,Vidal2004,Daley2004}, which borrows elements from DMRG in order to perform time-evolution of a matrix product state.\\
This chapter covers variational ground state search through the DMRG method and time-evolution of matrix product states through the tDMRG algorithm.


\section{Variational Ground State Search}
For large systems exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian is impossible, whereby one must resort to variational methods in order to find ground states. A variational search involves finding the state, $\ket{\psi}$, which minimizes
\begin{equation}
	E = \frac{\bra{\psi} \hat{H} \ket{\psi}}{\braket{\psi | \psi}} \; .
	\label{eq:variational}
\end{equation}
The Hamiltonian must be expressed as a matrix product operator to be applied to the state. An example is given in Appendix \ref{chap:buildMPO}, where the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian is formulated through tensors. Furthermore, in a variational search the state is repeatedly modified until the expectation value of the Hamiltonian is minimized. Therefore, the tensor network corresponding to eq. \ref{eq:variational} must be contracted efficiently in order for the search to be viable.


\subsection{Efficient Application of a Hamiltonian to an MPS}
Section \ref{sec:MPO} detailed the most effective way of applying a matrix product operator to a state, however, even further reductions to the computational cost are needed, as the overlap with the Hamiltonian is evaluated many times during the ground state search. The DMRG variational search algorithm updates only a single tensor of the state at a time, whereby most of the tensor network describing the operator overlap remains constant. Hence, most of the network can be stored and used for multiple calculations, which is one of the key properties of the DMRG algorithm.\\ 
Consider a matrix product state in a mixed-canonical form
\begin{align}
	\ket{\psi} &= \sum_{\boldsymbol{j}} A^{j_1} \ldots A^{j_{n-1}} \Psi^{j_n} B^{j_{n+1}} \ldots B^{j_{L}} \ket{\boldsymbol{j}} \nonumber \\
	&= \sum_{\alpha_{n-1} , \alpha_{n}} \ket{\alpha_{n-1}}_A \Psi_{\alpha_{n-1} , \alpha_{n}}^{j_n}  \ket{\alpha_{n}}_L \; ,
	\label{eq:MPSmixedsingle}
\end{align}
where $\Psi^{j_n}$ is the central site, and $\ket{\alpha_{n-1}}_A$ and $\ket{\alpha_{n}}_B$ are block states introduced in eq. \eqref{eq:mixedA} and \eqref{eq:mixedB} respectively. In the basis $\{ \ket{\alpha_{n-1} } \; , \; \ket{ j_n } \; , \; \ket{\alpha_{n} } \}$ the individual matrix elements of the Hamiltonian can be expressed as
\begin{equation*}
	\bra{\alpha_{n-1} j_n \alpha_{n}} \hat{H} \ket{\alpha_{n-1} ' j_n ' \alpha_{n} '} = \sum_{\boldsymbol{j} , \boldsymbol{j'}}  W^{j_1 , j_1 '} \ldots W^{j_L , j_L '}  \braket{\alpha_{n-1} j_n \alpha_{n} | \boldsymbol{j}} \braket{\boldsymbol{j'} | \alpha_{n-1} ' j_n ' \alpha_{n} '} \; . 
\end{equation*}
Since the basis of local states $\{ \ket{\boldsymbol{j}} \}$ shares a state with the basis $\{ \ket{\alpha_{n-1} } \; , \; \ket{ j_n } \; , \; \ket{\alpha_{n} } \}$, the above expression can be re-written using $\sum_{\boldsymbol{j}} \braket{j_n | \boldsymbol{j}} = \sum_{\boldsymbol{j *}} \ket{ \boldsymbol{j *}}$, where "$\boldsymbol{*}$" means "excluding $j_n$". Thus,
\begin{align}
&	\bra{\alpha_{n-1} j_n \alpha_{n}} \hat{H} \ket{\alpha_{n-1} ' j_n ' \alpha_{n} '} = \nonumber \\
 &= \sum_{\boldsymbol{j *} , \boldsymbol{j' * }}  W^{j_1 , j_1 '} \ldots W^{j_n , j_n '} \ldots W^{j_L , j_L '} \nonumber \\
	& \qquad \times \braket{\alpha_{n-1} | j_1 \ldots j_{n-1}} \braket{\alpha_{n} | j_{n+1} \ldots j_{L}} \braket{j_1 ' \ldots j_{n-1} ' | \alpha_{n-1} '} \braket{j_{n+1} ' \ldots j_{L} ' | \alpha_{n} '} \nonumber \\
	&= \sum_{\boldsymbol{j *} , \boldsymbol{j' * }}  W^{j_1 , j_1 '} \ldots W^{j_n , j_n '} \ldots W^{j_L , j_L '} \nonumber \\
	& \qquad \times \left( A^{j_1} \ldots A^{j_{n-1}} \right)_{1 , \alpha_{n-1}}^{*} \left( B^{j_{n+1}} \ldots B^{j_{L}} \right)_{ \alpha_{n} , 1}^{*} \left( A^{j_1 '} \ldots A^{j_{n-1} '} \right)_{1 , \alpha_{n-1} '} \left( B^{j_{n+1} '} \ldots B^{j_{L} '} \right)_{ \alpha_{n} ' , 1} \nonumber \\
	&= \sum_{\alpha_n , \beta_n , \alpha_n '}
	\left( \sum_{j_1 , j_1 '} A_{1 , \alpha_1}^{j_1 *} W_{1, \beta_1}^{j_1 , j_1 '} A_{1 , \alpha_1 '}^{j_1 '} \right)
	\left( \sum_{j_2 , j_2 '} A_{\alpha_1 , \alpha_2}^{j_2 *} W_{\beta_1, \beta_2}^{j_2 , j_2 '} A_{\alpha_1 ' , \alpha_2 '}^{j_2 '} \right)
	\ldots W_{\beta_{n_1}, \beta_n}^{j_n , j_n '} \nonumber \\
	& \qquad \times \left( \sum_{j_{n+1} , j_{n+1} '} B_{\alpha_n , \alpha_{n+1}}^{j_{n+1} *} W_{\beta_n, \beta_{n+1}}^{j_{n+1} , j_{n+1} '} B_{\alpha_n ', \alpha_{n+1} '}^{j_{n+1} '} \right)
	\left( \sum_{j_{L} , j_{L} '} B_{\alpha_{L-1} , 1}^{j_{L} *} W_{\beta_{L-1}, 1}^{j_{L} , j_{L} '} B_{\alpha_{L-1}' , 1 }^{j_{L} '} \right)  \; .
\end{align}  
While this expression may seem terrible complicated due to all the indices, it is actually rather easy to understand. First, the matrix element is written excluding the local basis state $\ket{j_n}$. Next, the Hamilton MPO is projected into the block states of A, $\ket{\alpha_{n-1}}_A$, and B, $\ket{\alpha_{n}}_B$. Finally, the matrices are grouped according to their expansion in the local basis. Working with the above expression appears cumbersome, but it is merely a decoupling of the system into three distinct parts, which can be seen in figure \ref{fig:singleElemHamil}.
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\input{Diagrams/singleElementHamiltonian.tex}
	\caption{\textit{Representation of the matrix element $\bra{\alpha_{n-1} j_n \alpha_{n}} \hat{H} \ket{\alpha_{n-1} ' j_n ' \alpha_{n} '}$ as an tensor network. The network can be factorize into three distinct parts: The left (L) and right (R) environments consisting of the contracted network to the left and right of the operator tensor, $W^[n]$, respectively.}}
	\label{fig:singleElemHamil}
\end{figure}
Since both the left and right side of the network is connected, one can contract these parts into two separate tensors $L$ and $R$ called \textit{environments}:
\begin{align}
	L_{\alpha_{n}, \beta_{n} , \alpha_{n} '} &= \sum_{ \substack{ \{ \alpha_i \beta_i \alpha_i ' \} \\ i < n}} \left( \sum_{j_1 , j_1 '} A_{1 , \alpha_1}^{j_1 *} W_{1, \beta_1}^{j_1 , j_1 '} A_{1 , \alpha_1 '}^{j_1 '} \right) \ldots \left( \sum_{j_{n} , j_{n} '} A_{\alpha_{n-1} , \alpha_{n}}^{j_{n} *} W_{\beta_{n-1}, \beta_{n}}^{j_{n} , j_{n} '} A_{\alpha_{n-1} ' , \alpha_{n} '}^{j_{n} '} \right) \label{eq:Ltensor} \\
	R_{\alpha_{n} ,\beta_{n} , \alpha_{n} '} &= \sum_{ \substack{ \{ \alpha_i \beta_i \alpha_i ' \} \\ i > n}} \left( \sum_{j_{n+1}  j_{n+1} '} B_{\alpha_n , \alpha_{n+1}}^{j_{n+1} *} W_{\beta_n, \beta_{n+1}}^{j_{n+1} , j_{n+1} '} B_{\alpha_n ', \alpha_{n+1} '}^{j_{n+1} '} \right) \ldots \nonumber \\
	& \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \times \left( \sum_{j_{L} , j_{L} '} B_{\alpha_{L-1} , 1}^{j_{L} *} W_{\beta_{L-1}, 1}^{j_{L} , j_{L} '} B_{\alpha_{L-1}' , 1 }^{j_{L} '} \right) \label{eq:Rtensor}
\end{align}
From these contractions, the tripartite structure of the Hamiltonian matrix element, as seen in figure \ref{fig:singleElemHamil}, can be written in a compact way
\begin{equation}
	\bra{\alpha_{n-1} j_n \alpha_{n}} \hat{H} \ket{\alpha_{n-1} ' j_n ' \alpha_{n} '} = \sum_{\beta_{n-1} , \beta_{n}} L_{\alpha_{n-1}, \beta_{n-1} , \alpha_{n-1} '} \; W_{\beta_{n_1}, \beta_n}^{j_n , j_n '} \; R_{\alpha_{n} ,\beta_{n} , \alpha_{n} '} \; .
\end{equation}
Finally, applying the Hamiltonian in the $\{ \ket{\alpha_{n-1} } \; , \; \ket{ j_n } \; , \; \ket{\alpha_{n} } \}$ basis to the MPS of eq. \eqref{eq:MPSmixedsingle} yields \cite{schollwock}
\begin{equation}
	\hat{H} \ket{\psi} = \sum_{\beta_{n-1} , \beta_{n}} \sum_{\alpha_{n-1}' , j_n ', \alpha_{n}'} L_{\alpha_{n-1}, \beta_{n-1} , \alpha_{n-1} '} \; W_{\beta_{n_1}, \beta_n}^{j_n , j_n '} \; R_{\alpha_{n} ,\beta_{n} , \alpha_{n} '} \; \Psi_{\alpha_{n-1} ' , \alpha_{n} '}^{j_n '} \ket{\alpha_{n-1}}_A \ket{j_n} \ket{\alpha_{n}}_B \; .
	\label{eq:HPsi}
\end{equation}
Expressing $\hat{H}$ in the basis of the block states exposes the central site of the MPS such that it can be varied in a ground state search. Evaluating $\hat{H} \ket{\psi}$ must be done many times during a variational search of the ground state, hence this operation must be executed as fast as possible. Examining eq. \eqref{eq:HPsi} one will notice, that while the boundaries of $L$ and $R$ will change depending on which site is being optimized, the bulk of the two tensors remain constant through a lot of the calculations. Instead of calculating $L$ and $R$ from eq. \eqref{eq:Ltensor} and \eqref{eq:Rtensor} for every evaluation of eq. \eqref{eq:HPsi}, one can iteratively build them, since they only change by one column of the network at a time. Thus, a large number of computations can be reused.\\
Consider the construction of the tensor $L^{[i]}$, which can be built iteratively from the left by contracting the previous left-tensor $L^{[i-1]}$ with the i'th column of the network consisting of $A^{[i]}$, $W^{[i]}$ and $A^{[i] \dag}$
\begin{equation}
	L_{\alpha_i , \beta_i , \alpha_i '}^{[i]} = \sum_{\substack{ j_i , j_i ' \\ \alpha_{i-1} , \beta_{i-1} , \alpha_{i-1} '}} W_{\beta_{i-1} , \beta_i}^{[i] j_i , j_i '} \left( A^{[i] j_i \dag} \right)_{\alpha_i , \alpha_{i-1}} L_{\alpha_{i-1} , \beta_{i-1} , \alpha_{i-1} '}^{[i-1]} A_{\alpha_{i-1} ' , \alpha_i '}^{[i] j_i '} \; .
\end{equation}
The iterative update of $L^{[i]}$ can be seen illustrated in figure \ref{fig:buildLTensor}. The square-bracket notation has been re-introduced to keep track of the tensors relation to the physical sites. In order to remain consistent with notation, the dummy scalars $L_{\alpha_0 , \beta_0 , \alpha_0 '}^{[0]}  = 1  = \alpha_0 , \beta_0 , \alpha_0 '$ have been introduced.\\
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\input{Diagrams/buildLTensor.tex}
	\caption{\textit{Iterative update from $L^{[i-1]}$ to $L^{[i]}$ through a contraction of $L^{[i-1]}$ with $A^{[i]}$, $W^{[i]}$ and $A^{[i] \dag}$. The result is a tensor with three horizontal legs.}}
	\label{fig:buildLTensor}
\end{figure}
It is important to store every iteration of $L^{[i]}$, since $L$ will grow and shrink constantly throughout the variational search of the ground state, whereby every iteration of $L^{[i]}$ will be used multiple times.
The same applies when building the right environment, $R$. Here one starts from the right and moves left when iteratively contracting the tensor. By applying optimal bracketing, the computational cost of updating the environments scales as $\mathrm{O}(d D^3 D_W)$.
  

\subsection{Iterative Ground State Search and the DMRG Algorithm} \label{sec:DMRG}
In order to find the ground state of the system on can introduce a Lagrangian multiplier, $\lambda$, and extremize
\begin{equation}
	\bra{\psi} \hat{H} \ket{\psi} - \lambda \braket{\psi | \psi} \; ,
	\label{eq:lagrange}
\end{equation}
whereby the desired ground state, $\ket{\psi}$, and ground state energy, $\lambda^0$, will be reached.\\
Trying to optimize an entire MPS at once is a highly non-linear problem involving an extremely large number of variables. However, the problem can be linearised by only considering the variables of a single tensor (site) at a time, while keeping the rest of the MPS constant. By varying just a single tensor at a time, one will continuously find states lower in energy, until convergence is reached. However, this procedure is very prone to getting stuck in a local extrema. To circumvent this, one can consider two sites at a time and optimize with regards to a two-site tensor, created by momentarily merging the two sites \cite{White1993}.\\
Consider the variation of the tensors $M^{[n]}$ and $M^{[n+1]}$. Expressing the minimization problem of eq. \eqref{eq:lagrange} in terms of the left and right environments (as done in eq. \eqref{eq:HPsi}) yields
\begin{align}
	\bra{\psi} \hat{H} \ket{\psi} &= \sum_{\substack{j_n , j_n ' \\ j_{n+1} , j_{n+1} '}} \sum_{\alpha_{n-1} ' , \alpha_n ', \alpha_{n+1} '} \sum_{\alpha_{n-1} , \alpha_n , \alpha_{n+1}} \sum_{\beta_{n-1} , \beta_n , \beta_{n+1}} L_{\alpha_{n-1}, \beta_{n-1} , \alpha_{n-1} '}^{[n-1]} \; W_{\beta_{n_1}, \beta_n}^{j_n , j_n '} \; W_{\beta_{n}, \beta_{n+1}}^{ j_{n+1} , j_{n+1} '} \nonumber \\
	& \qquad \times R_{\alpha_{n+1} ,\beta_{n+1} , \alpha_{n+1} '}^{[n+2]} \; M_{\alpha_{n-1} , \alpha_{n}}^{j_n } \; M_{\alpha_{n-1} ' , \alpha_{n} '}^{j_n ' *} \; M_{\alpha_{n} , \alpha_{n+1}}^{j_{n+1} } \; M_{\alpha_{n} ' , \alpha_{n+1} '}^{j_{n+1} ' *}  \label{eq:twositeHamil}
\end{align}
with the overlap
\begin{align}
	\braket{\psi | \psi} &= \sum_{j_n , j_{n+1} } \sum_{\substack{\alpha_{n-1} ' \\ \alpha_n ', \alpha_{n+1} '}} \sum_{\alpha_{n-1} , \alpha_n ,\alpha_{n+1}} \Psi_{\alpha_{n-1},\alpha_{n-1}'}^{A} \; M_{\alpha_{n-1} , \alpha_{n}}^{ j_n } \; M_{\alpha_{n-1} ' , \alpha_{n} '}^{j_n ' *} \nonumber \\
	& \qquad \times M_{\alpha_{n} , \alpha_{n+1}}^{j_{n+1} } \; M_{\alpha_{n} ' , \alpha_{n+1} '}^{j_{n+1} ' *} \; \Psi_{\alpha_{n+1},\alpha_{n+1}'}^{B} \; , \label{eq:twositeOverlap}
\end{align}
where the Hamiltonian from eq. \eqref{eq:HPsi} has been re-ordered to accommodate examining two sites, $n$ and $n+1$, at a time, and 
\begin{align}
\Psi_{\alpha_{n-1},\alpha_{n-1}'}^{A} &= \sum_{j_1 , \ldots , j_{n-1}} \left( M^{j_{n-1} \dag} \ldots M^{j_{1} \dag} M^{j_1} \ldots M^{j_{n-1}} \right) _{\alpha_{n-1} , \alpha_{n-1} '} \label{eq:psiA} \\
\Psi_{\alpha_{n+1},\alpha_{n+1}'}^{B} &= \sum_{j_{n+2} , \ldots , j_{L}} \left( M^{j_{n+2} } \ldots M^{j_{L} } M^{j_L \dag} \ldots M^{j_{n+2} \dag} \right) _{\alpha_{n+1} ', \alpha_{n+1} } \; .
\end{align}
Further simplifications can be made for mixed-canonical forms, if sites $1$ through $n-1$ are left-normalized, and sites $n+2$ through $L$ are right-normalized, whereby
\begin{equation}
	\Psi_{\alpha_{n-1},\alpha_{n-1}'}^{A} = \delta_{\alpha_{n-1},\alpha_{n-1}'} \qquad , \qquad \Psi_{\alpha_{n+1},\alpha_{n+1}'}^{B} = \delta_{\alpha_{n+1},\alpha_{n+1}'} \; .
\end{equation}
Finding the extremum of eq. \eqref{eq:lagrange} with respect to $M_{\alpha_{n-1} ' , \alpha_{n} '}^{[n] j_n ' *} \; M_{\alpha_{n} ' , \alpha_{n+1} '}^{[n+1] j_{n+1} ' *}$ is done through the following sequence:

\subsubsection{Two-site update for iterative ground state search}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\textbf{Merge:} Contract the two matrices $M^{[n]}$ and $M^{[n+1]}$ over the bond $\alpha_{n}$ creating a two-site tensor
\begin{equation}
\Theta_{\alpha_{n-1} , \alpha_{n+1}}^{j_n , j_{n+1}} = \sum_{\alpha_n} M_{\alpha_{n-1} , \alpha_{n}}^{[n] j_n } \;  M_{\alpha_{n} , \alpha_{n+1}}^{[n+1] j_{n+1} } 
\end{equation}

\item
\textbf{Solve eigenproblem:} This yields an eigenvalue problem, which can be seen by reshaping
\begin{align}
	H_{( \alpha_{n-1}  j_n  j_{n+1}, \alpha_{n+1}),(\alpha_{n-1}'  j_n '  j_{n+1}', \alpha_{n+1}')} &= \nonumber \\
	= \; \sum_{\substack{\beta_{n-1} , \beta_n \\ \beta_{n+1}}} L_{\alpha_{n-1}, \beta_{n-1} , \alpha_{n-1} '}^{[n-1]} & \; W_{\beta_{n_1}, \beta_n}^{[n] j_n , j_n '} \; W_{\beta_{n}, \beta_{n+1}}^{[n+1] j_{n+1} , j_{n+1} '}\;  R_{\alpha_{n+1} ,\beta_{n+1} , \alpha_{n+1} '}^{[n+2]} 
\end{align}
and
\begin{equation}
	v_{ \alpha_{n-1} j_n j_{n+1} \alpha_{n+1}} = \; \Theta_{\alpha_{n-1} , \alpha_{n+1}}^{j_n , j_{n+1}}
\end{equation}
such that
\begin{equation}
	H v - \lambda v = 0 \; .
	\label{eq:eigprob}
\end{equation}
Solving eq. \eqref{eq:eigprob} for the lowest eigenvalue $\lambda_0$ yields $v_{ \alpha_{n-1} j_n j_{n+1} \alpha_{n+1}}^0$, which can be reshaped back to the now optimized two-site tensor, $\tilde{\Theta}_{\alpha_{n-1} , \alpha_{n+1}}^{j_n , j_{n+1}}$.

\item
\textbf{Unmerge:} Reshape the updated $\tilde{\Theta}_{\alpha_{n-1} , \alpha_{n+1}}^{j_n , j_{n+1}}$ to a matrix and perform an SVD yielding
\begin{equation}
	\tilde{\Theta}_{(j_n \alpha_{n-1} ) ,(j_{n+1}  \alpha_{n+1} )} = \sum_{\alpha_n} U_{\alpha_{n-1} , \alpha_{n}}^{j_n} S_{\alpha_n , \alpha_n} (V^{\dag})_{\alpha_{n} , \alpha_{n+1}}^{j_{n+1}} \; .
\end{equation}
This causes the bond dimension to increase $D \rightarrow d D$, which must be truncated by keeping only the $D$ largest singular values of $S$. 

\item
\textbf{Update environments:} The last step depends on which direction, one is iterating trough the chain. Here, the left- and right-normalization of $U$ and $V^{\dag}$ is used to update the environments.\\
\textit{Going right}: Update the left environment
\begin{equation}
	\tilde{L}_{\alpha_{n}, \beta_{n} , \alpha_{n} '}^{[n]} = \sum_{\substack{ j_{n} , j_{n} ' \\ \alpha_{n-1} , \beta_{n-1} , \alpha_{n-1} '}} L_{\alpha_{n-1}, \beta_{n-1} , \alpha_{n-1} '}^{[n-1]} \; U_{\alpha_{n-1} , \alpha_{n}}^{j_n} \; W_{\beta_{n-1} , \beta_{n}}^{[n] j_n , j_n '} \; U_{\alpha_{n-1} ', \alpha_{n}'}^{j_n ' *} \; ,
\label{eq:updateLeft}
\end{equation}
and build the matrix of the right site
\begin{equation}
	\tilde{M}_{\alpha_{n} , \alpha_{n+1}}^{[n+1] j_{n+1} } = \sum_{\alpha_n}  S_{\alpha_n , \alpha_n} (V^{\dag})_{\alpha_{n} , \alpha_{n+1}}^{j_{n+1}} \; .
\end{equation}\\ 
\textit{Going left}: Update the right environment
\begin{equation}
	\tilde{R}_{\alpha_{n}, \beta_{n} , \alpha_{n} '}^{[n+1]} = \sum_{\substack{ j_{n+1} , j_{n+1} ' \\ \alpha_{n+1} , \beta_{n+1} , \alpha_{n+1} '}} R_{\alpha_{n+1}, \beta_{n+1} , \alpha_{n+1} '}^{[n+2]} \; \left( V^{\dag} \right)_{\alpha_{n} , \alpha_{n+1}}^{j_{n+1}} \; W_{\beta_{n} , \beta_{n+1}}^{[n+1] j_{n+1} , j_{n+1} '} \; \left( V^{\dag} \right)_{\alpha_{n} , \alpha_{n+1}}^{j_{n+1} *} \; ,
	\label{eq:updateRight}
\end{equation}
and build the matrix of the left site
\begin{equation}
	\tilde{M}_{\alpha_{n-1} , \alpha_{n}}^{[n] j_{n} } = \sum_{\alpha_n} U_{\alpha_{n-1} , \alpha_{n}}^{j_n} S_{\alpha_n , \alpha_n}  \; .
\end{equation} 
 
\end{enumerate}
This concludes the two-site update sequence, which is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:twoSiteUpdate}. After performing the sequence, one can move \textit{one site} to either left or right, depending on which direction one is iterating.

	\label{fig:twoSiteUpdate}
\end{figure}

Some comments regarding the sequence are in order: The matrices of the eigenvalue problem have dimensions $( d^2 D^2 \times d^2 D^2)$, which is generally too much for exact diagonalization, however, since only the lowest eigenvalue is of interest, one can use an iterative eigensolver \cite{Lanczos}. Furthermore, if the MPS is not in the proper mixed-canonical form, the eigenvalue problem turns into a generalized eigenvalue problem, which can be numerically quite demanding. Thus, updating the left and right environments in step (4) is necessary, since it leads to great simplifications in step (2). Lastly, one could also consider just a single site when updating, however, this method is very prone to getting stuck \cite{White2005}. By updating two sites at once, one actually optimizes the bond between them. Hence, after updating the two sites, one must only iterate a single site. Optimization is done with regards to the current configuration, whereby it depends on previous updates. To compensate for this, one must sweep through the entire system multiple times, which leads to the following algorithm for iterative ground state search, which follows the structure of the DMRG algorithm:

\begin{algorithm}
\begin{algorithmic}
\caption{Iterative ground state search (DMRG)}
\State Choose $\ket{\psi}$ right-normalized.
\State Calculate tensor $R^{[i]}$ iteratively for $i = L \ldots 1$.
\While{Stopping criteria not met} 
	\For{$n = 1 \ldots L-1$} \Comment{Left sweep}
		\State Perform two-site update on $M^{[n]}$ and $M^{[n+1]}$.
		\State Update $L^{[n]}$ according to eq. \eqref{eq:updateLeft}
	\EndFor
	\For{$n = L-1 \ldots 1$} \Comment{Right sweep}
		\State Perform two-site update on $M^{[n]}$ and $M^{[n+1]}$.
		\State Update $R^{[n]}$ according to eq. \eqref{eq:updateRight}
	\EndFor
\EndWhile
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Examples of the DMRG algorithm can be found in section \ref{sec:CorrelationLength}, where the ground state of the Bose-Hubbard model is calculated for a lattice with 50 sites. The ground state is used to compute correlation functions of the system, and the example illustrates how matrix product states and the DMRG algorithm struggle when the correlation lengths grow very large. Another example can be found in appendix \ref{chap:CondFrac}, where the condensate fraction for various system sizes is computed in an attempt to determine the point of the superfluid to Mott-Insulator phase transition. Furthermore, the results obtained through the DMRG are compared with those of exact diagonalization.


\section{Time Evolution of Matrix Product States}
A central component of optimal control is time evolution. In order to compute any optimal control sequence, it is crucial to have a fast and accurate time evolution algorithm. However, also the construction of the time evolution operator must be taken into account, as exponentiating operators with terms acting on multiple sites, such as the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian, is a costly operation. Thus, both an efficient time evolution algorithm and an efficient operator exponentiation is needed when performing optimal control.\\
Several algorithms for time evolving matrix product states exist, however, they all origin from the same ideas proposed in \cite{Vidal2003,Vidal2004}. The most widely used of these algorithms is the tDMRG algorithm \cite{Daley2004}, which gets its name from its similarity with the ground state search algorithm described in section \ref{sec:DMRG}. The tDMRG algorithm has been utilized in several instances to simulate the dynamics of one-dimensional systems \cite{Verstraete2004,Vznidarivc2008,Cazalilla2002}, and it has even been previously used in conjunction with the CRAB algorithm to perform optimal control of the superfluid to Mott-Insulator phase transition \cite{FrankBloch,Doria2011}.\\
Although the standard algorithms for time evolution are quite efficient, further improvements can be made to the algorithms by tailoring them to the problem at hand. Therefore, a modified version of the tDMRG algorithm is proposed in Section \ref{sec:modTMDRG}, which directly utilizes the properties of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian.


\subsection{The tDMRG Algorithm}
Consider the time evolution of a quantum state
\begin{equation}
	\ket{\psi (t)} = \hat{\mathcal{U}}(t) \ket{\psi (0)} \; ,
\end{equation}
where $\hat{\mathcal{U}}(t) = \e^{ - \im \hat{H} t }$ is the time evolution operator. 
Time evolution of a matrix product states is done in a manner similar to that of ground state search, as the bonds between the tensors are evolved rather than the tensors themselves \cite{Vidal2003,Vidal2004}. Thus, the time evolution operator must be decomposed into two-site tensors. The simplest realization of this is achieved by considering a Hamiltonian containing only nearest-neighbour interactions.
Assume the Hamiltonian is a sum of two-site operators of the form $\hat{H} = \sum_{n} \hat{h}^{[n , n+1]}$. One can decompose this into a sum over even and odd bonds \cite{Vidal2004}
\begin{equation}
	\hat{H} = \hat{H}_{\mathrm{odd}} \; + \; \hat{H}_{\mathrm{even}} = \sum_{n \; \mathrm{odd}} \hat{h}^{[n , n+1]} \; + \; \sum_{n \; \mathrm{even}} \hat{h}^{[n , n+1]} \; .
\end{equation}  
Exponentiating the Hamiltonian is non-trivial due to the non-commutativity of the operators
\begin{equation}
	[ \hat{h}_{\mathrm{odd}}^{[n , n+1]} \; , \; \hat{h}_{\mathrm{even}}^{[n , n+1]} ] \neq 0 \; .
\end{equation}
Considering a small time slice, $\Delta t$, the exponentiation can be achieved through the Trotter-Suzuki expansion \cite{Suzuki1991}. To first order this reads
\begin{equation}
	\e^{- \im \hat{H} \; \Delta t} = \e^{- \im \hat{H}_{\mathrm{odd}} \; \Delta t } \e^{- \im \hat{H}_{\mathrm{even}} \; \Delta t} \; + \; \;  \mathrm{O}(\Delta t^2) \; ,
\end{equation}
where the error is due to the non-commutativity of the bond Hamiltonians. Thus, the time evolution operator can be expressed as the product
\begin{equation}
	\hat{\mathcal{U}}(\Delta t) \approx \left( \prod_{n \; \mathrm{odd}} \hat{\mathcal{U}}^{[n,n+1]} (\Delta t) \right) \left( \prod_{n \; \mathrm{even}} \hat{\mathcal{U}}^{[n,n+1]} (\Delta t) \right) \; , \label{eq:SuzukiTrotter1stOrder}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
	\hat{\mathcal{U}}^{[n,n+1]} (\Delta t) = \e^{- \im \hat{h}^{[n , n+1]} \; \Delta t } \; .
\end{equation}
The result is an MPO performing an infinitesimal time step on the odd bonds, and another MPO evolving the even bonds. An illustration of eq. \eqref{eq:SuzukiTrotter1stOrder} is shown in Figure \ref{fig:oddevenops}.
\begin{figure}[h!]

	\label{fig:oddevenops}
\end{figure}
The tDMRG algorithm describes the most efficient and accurate way of contracting the tensor network detailed in figure \ref{fig:oddevenops}. The algorithm gets its name from its similarity with the DMRG algorithm detailed in section \ref{sec:DMRG}. In fact, the merge and unmerge procedure of the two algorithms is completely identical, whereby they only differ in the steps of applying the operator and proceeding to the next site. The following procedure details a time evolution step of the $n$'th bond \cite{schollwock}.

\subsubsection{Infinitesimal time-step update for tDMRG}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
\textbf{Merge:} Contract tensors $M^{[n]}$ and $M^{[n+1]}$ over the bond $\alpha_{n}$ creating a two-site tensor $\Theta^{j_n , j_{n+1}}$.

\item
\textbf{Apply unitary:} The two-site time evolution operator, $\hat{\mathcal{U}}^{[n, n+1]}$, is applied to $\Theta^{j_n , j_{n+1}}$
\begin{equation}
	\tilde{\Theta}_{\alpha_{n-1} , \alpha_{n+1}}^{j_n , j_{n+1} } = \sum_{j_n ', j_{n+1}'} \mathcal{U}^{j_n  j_{n+1} , j_n '  j_{n+1}'} \; \Phi_{\alpha_{n-1} , \alpha_{n+1}}^{j_n ', j_{n+1} ' } \; .
\end{equation}

\item
\textbf{Unmerge:} Reshape $\tilde{\Phi}_{\alpha_{n-1} , \alpha_{n+1}}^{j_n ', j_{n+1} '}$ to a matrix and decompose it through an SVD. Applying $\hat{\mathcal{U}}^{[n, n+1]}$ causes an increase in bond dimension, $D \rightarrow d^2 D$, which must be truncated by keeping only the $D$ largest singular values from the SVD. 

\item
\textbf{Progress:}  Next, the center cite of the MPS must be shifted by two, in order to update the next even (odd) bond. This is achieved by merging tensors $M^{[n+1]}$ and $M^{[n+2]}$ and performing a second SVD, while reshaping the resulting $U$-matrices to left-normalised tensors to retain the canonical form. The product of the second SVD must be truncated as well, however, no loss of information will occur, as the Schmidt rank of the matrix $S$ will be at most $D$ following the first SVD. 
\end{enumerate}
Following the procedure above will leave the MPS in position for application of the unitary $\hat{\mathcal{U}}^{[n+2 , n+3]}$. The efficiency of the tDMRG algorithm depends on the sequence in which bonds are evolved. A simple, yet effective way is iterating from left to right when evolving even bonds, while iterating right to left when evolving odd bonds. Thereby, the centered cite of the mixed-canonical form is moved continuously through the MPS, rather than having to be reset when reaching the end of the system.\\
Although the tDMRG algorithm is a very powerful algorithm, an even higher efficiency can be achieved when tailoring the algorithm to the system, which in this care is the Bose-Hubbard model. Thus, the Hamiltonian contains both nearest-neighbour and on-site terms. Furthermore, the Hamiltonian is time dependent, since the lattice depth is varied when driving a phase transition. The following algorithm is a modification of the tDMRG algorithm, which is tailored for conducting optimal control using the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian.


\subsection{Modified Time Evolution Algorithm for Bose-Hubbard Model}
\label{sec:modTMDRG}
In the control problem treated in this thesis, a Bose-Hubbard system is dynamically manipulated in order to cross the phase transition between the superfluid and the Mott-Insulator. Thus, the Hamiltonian is time-dependent, whereby it must be exponentiated for every time-step to create the propagators required for the time-evolution. Furthermore, any optimization of the control sequence will the corresponding propagators to be re-calculated. Thus, the computational time of the propagators must be taken into account. Typically, operators are exponentiated through their series expansion, however, this is in general a rather expensive operation. Therefore, choosing control-Hamiltonians which are easy to exponentiate is often an advantage.\\
The phase of the Bose-Hubbard model depends on the ratio $U/J$, where $U$ is the interaction matrix element \eqref{eq:BHparamU}, and $J$ is the tunneling matrix element \eqref{eq:BHparamJ}. Both parameters are dependent of the lattice depth, which therefore has been used as control function in previous studies \cite{FrankBloch,Doria2011}. Exponentiating the tunneling Hamiltonian is non-trivial, however, the interaction Hamiltonian is diagonal, whereby the propagator can be computed by simply exponentiating the elements of the matrix. Thus, choosing the ratio $U/J$ as the control function and working in units of $J$ significantly simplifies the calculation of propagators, as the tunneling propagator remains constant. Employing a second-order Suzuki-Trotter expansion
\begin{equation}
	\exp\left( \text{-}i ( \hat{H}_J + \hat{H}_U  ) \Delta t \right) = \exp\left( \text{-} i \hat{H}_U \Delta t /2  \right) \exp\left( \text{-} i \hat{H}_J \Delta  t \right) \exp\left( \text{-} i \hat{H}_U \Delta t /2  \right) + O(\Delta t^3) \; ,
	\label{eq:SuzukiTrotter}
\end{equation}
allows separate exponentiation of the two parts of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian, whereby only the interaction needs to be updated. Again, the error is due to the non-commutativity of operators. Thereby, the expanded propagator reads
\begin{equation}
	\hat{\mathcal{U}} (\Delta t) = \left( \prod_{i = 1}^{L} \hat{\mathcal{U}}_{U}^{[i]} \right) \left( \prod_{i \; \mathrm{odd}}^{L} \hat{\mathcal{U}}_{J}^{[i,i+1]}  \right) \left( \prod_{i \; \mathrm{even}}^{L} \hat{\mathcal{U}}_{J}^{[i,i+1]}  \right) \left( \prod_{i = 1}^{L} \hat{\mathcal{U}}_{U}^{[i]} \right) \; ,
\end{equation}
where the site-specific propagators, or gates, are given by
\begin{align}
	\hat{\mathcal{U}}_{J}^{[i,i+1]} &= \exp \left( \text{-} i J ( \hat{a}_{i}^{\dag} \hat{a}_{i+1} + \hat{a}_{i+1}^{\dag} \hat{a}_{i} ) \Delta t \right) \\
	\hat{\mathcal{U}}_{U}^{[i]} &= \exp \left( \text{-} i \frac{U}{2} \hat{n}_i (\hat{n}_i -1) \Delta t /2 \right) \; .
\end{align}

	\label{fig:ModifiedTEBD}
\end{figure}
A single time step, $\Delta t$, using the expanded operator is represented diagrammatically in figure \ref{fig:ModifiedTEBD}. At first glance, the tensor network resulting from the Suzuki-Trotter expansion may seem rather extensive, however, it can be contracted in a very efficient manner. The upper part of the network is contracted in a left-to-right sweeping manner, where the position of the center cite, and thereby the normalisation of the MPS, is pushed to the right following each step. Likewise, the lower part of the network is contracted though a right-to-left sweep such that the MPS returns to its original form centered on the first site after applying the final operator. Thereby, the MPS is immediately ready for the subsequent time-propagation.\\

The propagated two-site tensor is split using an SVD in step \textbf{(3)}, followed by a contraction to the right.

\label{fig:TEBDContraction}
\end{figure}
The sequence of contractions of the left-to-right sweep is shown in figure \ref{fig:TEBDContraction}. The MPS is initially centered on the first tensor, while its remaining tensors are right-normalised. By contracting the bonds marked with a bold line shown in step 1 and 2, the operators are efficiently applied to the MPS. In the third step, the two-site tensor, $\Theta$, is split using an SVD, where the bond dimension of the tensors is truncated. This is crucial in order to maintain a reduced dimensionality, which would otherwise result in a significant increase in contraction time. In the final and fourth step, the central cite of the MPS is moved to the start of the next two-site operator through another site merge and subsequent SVD. This step is exactly as in the original tDMRG algorithm. Thereby the normalization of the MPS is "pushed" to the right and contained in a single site, which makes it easy to deal with in the end of the time evolution step.\\
As the center reaches the end of the MPS, the direction of the sweep is reversed. The right-to-left sweep is very similar to the sequence described above. The main difference is in the order of contractions, as the $\hat{\mathcal{U}}_{J}^{[i,i+1]}$-propagator is applied before $\hat{\mathcal{U}}_{U}^{[i]}$. As the sweep, and thereby the central cite, reaches the first site of the MPS, the central site is divided by its norm. Thereby the MPS is normalized and in the same configuration as before the time step. Thus, further propagations can be performed readily.\\ 
Additional precision is achieved when evaluating the control at the beginning and end points of the time interval \cite{Steck2007}. Thus, the left-to-right sweep applies the operator $\hat{\mathcal{U}}_{U(t)}^{[i]} $, while the right-to-left sweep applies $\hat{\mathcal{U}}_{U(t + \Delta t)}^{[i]}$.


\subsubsection{Time complexity of time-evolution algorithms}
The Suzuki-Trotter expansion \eqref{eq:SuzukiTrotter} does not determine the ordering of the operators. Thus, an alternative algorithm can be derived, where the half-step is taken using the $\hat{\mathcal{U}}_{J}^{[i,i+1]}$ operator. However, applying the two-site operators is in general more time consuming than applying two single-site operator.
\begin{figure}[h!]

    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Figures/CompareRuntime.pdf}
    \caption{\textit{Runtime of performing 100 time steps with various algorithms in Bose Hubbard system with unit occupancy. Solid lines are systems with a local Fock space of dimension $N$, while dashed lines are systems with a constant Fock space dimension of 5.}}
    \label{fig:CompareRuntime}
\end{figure}
A comparison between the run-times of various time-evolution algorithms in shown in Figure \ref{fig:CompareRuntime}. The two tDMRG algorithms are the one described above using a half-step of $\hat{\mathcal{U}}_{J}$ and $\hat{\mathcal{U}}_{U}$ respectively. The MPO-based algorithm builds the propagator using ITensor library \cite{ITensor} methods following \cite{Pollmann2015}, and the resulting MPO is applied to the MPS according to eq. \eqref{eq:optBracketsMPO}. This method has an error of order $O(\Delta t ^2)$, which is less accurate than the second-order Trotter expansion.
In Section \ref{sec:MPO} the cost of applying an MPO to an MPS was given by $\mathrm{O}(L d^2 D_W ^2 D^2)$. Considering the single-site tensors of the tDMRG algorithms, $D_W$ is zero. Since $d = L$ for the solid lines in Figure \ref{fig:CompareRuntime}, the runtime of the algorithm will have a cubic scaling with the system size. However, a much better scaling can be achieved by truncating the local Hilbert space, such that $d$ is kept constant resulting in a runtime scaling linearly with the system size.
In the case of the Bose Hubbard model, eq. \eqref{BHhamil}, the interaction term scales quadratically with the number of particles at a given site, which causes a huge energy penalty. Thus, for large systems with unit occupation, neglecting contributions from states with a majority of the particles at a single site is a reasonable approximation.
Therefore, the modified tDMRG algorithm can be applied efficiently to very large systems, if the dimension of the physical index of the MPS is restricted to a reasonable fraction of the number of particles.
