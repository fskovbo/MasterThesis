\chapter{Ultracold Quantum Gases in Optical Lattices}

Ultracold atoms present an extremely powerful tool in quantum reasearch. At the scale of nanokelvins thermal effects no longer destroy the otherwise fragile quantum systems. Thus, quantum phenomena, previously known only from theory, can be studied directly. Atomic physics experiments with such ultracold, quantum degenerate gases offer some unique features: (i) a wide range of Hamiltonians can be mapped to the systems making experiments highly customizable. This can in part be attributed to (ii) the very high degree of control achievable through the manipulation of external fields. Many different configurations of magnetic and optical traps achievable in which the cold atoms can be manipulated very precisely. Furthermore, the collisional properties of the atoms can be tuned through magnetic Feshbach resonances, and the properties of the gas can be probed through interactions between internal energy levels of the atoms and laser light \cite{JakschZoller, Bloch2012}.

At temperature scales around $\approx 100 \mathrm{nK}$ many-body phenomena such as Bose-Einstein condensation takes place, where the ground state of the system gains a macroscopic populations. Ever since the first realisation of a Bose-Einstein condensate in 1995 \cite{WiemanCornell1995}, the special properties of this macroscopic quantum state have been used in a wide range of experiments. A powerful tool in the cold-atoms toolbox is the optical lattice, which is an array of potentials created through the atoms dipole interaction with laser beams. The cold atoms are loaded into the highly controllable lattice from where one can perform quantum simulations of various systems, such as spin chains \cite{Simon2011}, Dirac cones \cite{Tarruell2012}, and artificial gauge fields \cite{Dalibard2011}. Furtermore, the properties of cold atoms in optical lattices are very favourable for experiments in quantum information, where quantum gates can be realised through controlled collisions \cite{Zoller1999} or Rydberg atoms \cite{Molmer2010}.

\section{Optical Lattice Potentials}
Cold atoms can be trapped in potentials generated by their own dipole interaction with light. Thus, superimposing laser beams allows one to create optical potentials in various shapes and forms. Such dipole traps realised using far-detuned light have important properties, as (i) they are capable of trapping neutral atoms, and (ii) the optical excitation from the trap is very low resulting in only small losses \cite{grimm}. Optical lattices are a central component of many experiments, as they not only trap the atoms, but also determine important properties of the system.

\subsection{Trapping of Neutral Atoms}
Consider a two level atom in the presence of a time-varying electric field
\begin{equation}
	\boldsymbol{E} = \boldsymbol{\varepsilon} E_0 \exp \left( i(\boldsymbol{k} \boldsymbol{r} - \omega_L t) \right) \; ,
\end{equation}
where $E_0$ is its amplitude, $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$ is its polarization vector, $\boldsymbol{k}$ is its wave vector and $\omega_L$ is its frequency. The interaction between the atom and the electric field causes a perturbation of the atoms energy levels, otherwise known as the AC Stark-shift. The Hamiltonian describing this interaction is
\begin{equation}
	\hat{H}_{int} = \hat{d} \boldsymbol{E} \; , \label{eq:Hdipint}
\end{equation}
where $\hat{d} = -e \hat{r}$ is the electric dipole operator.\\
Consider eq. \eqref{eq:Hdipint} as a perturbation to the Hamiltonian of the atom. To first order the non-degenerate, time-independent perturbation of the energy of state $i$ reads
\begin{equation}
	E_{i}^{(i)} = \bra{i} \hat{H}_{int} \ket{i} \; .
\end{equation}
However, all first-order contributions vanish due to the symmetry of the Hamiltonian \eqref{eq:Hdipint}.\\
To second order the perturbation of state $i$ is given by
\begin{equation}
	E_i^{(2)} = \sum_{j \neq i} \frac{ |\bra{j} \hat{H}_{int}\ket{i}|^2}{\varepsilon_i - \varepsilon_j} \; .
\end{equation}
The states $\ket{i}$ and $\ket{j}$ and their corresponding energies, $\varepsilon_i$ and $\varepsilon_j$, are of the dressed state picture, where one considers the combined system of the atom and the light field \cite{cohen1992atom}. The state $\ket{i}$ represents the atom being in its ground state, while the light field contains $n$ photons. Thus, the energy of the combined state is $\varepsilon_i = n \hbar \omega_L$, when setting the energy of the atomic ground state to zero. Meanwhile, state $\ket{j}$ is when the atom has been excited by absorbing one of the photons of the field. Hence, the energy of this state is $\varepsilon_j = \hbar \omega_0 + (n-1) \hbar \omega_L$. Defining the detuning $\Delta = \omega_L - \omega_0$ allows writing the perturbation in the form
\begin{equation}
	E_{g/e}^{(2)}=\pm  \frac{ |\bra{e}\hat{d}\ket{g}|^2}{\Delta} |E_0|^2,
	\label{2ndpert}
\end{equation}
where the upper sign is assigned to the atomic ground state $\ket{g}$. This can be rewritten in order to reflect properties of the atom and the field, by considering the intensity of the light, $I = 2 \epsilon_0 c |\boldsymbol{E}|^2 $, and the decay rate of the atom, $\Gamma = \frac{\omega_{0}^3}{3 \pi \epsilon_0 c^3} |\braket{e | \hat{d} | g}|$. Thus, equation \eqref{2ndpert} can be written as \cite{grimm} 
\begin{equation}
	E_{e/g}^{(2)}=\pm \frac{3 \pi c^2}{2 \omega_{0}^3} \frac{\Gamma}{\Delta}I
	\label{eq:dipolepot}
\end{equation}
This is the AC-Stark shift, which constitutes the dipole potential. For red detuning ($\Delta < 0$) the ground state will experience a negative shift leading to an attractive potential with depth depending on the intensity of the laser. Oppositely, a blue-detuned laser ($\Delta > 0$) will repel the atom. An illustration of this can be seen in figure \ref{fig:ac_stark}.
\begin{figure}[!h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\columnwidth]{Figures/acstark.JPG} 
	\caption{\textit{Light shifts of a two-level atom. Left-hand side,
		red-detuned light ($\Delta < 0$) shifts the ground state down and the
		excited state up by same amounts. Right-hand side, a spatially
		inhomogeneous field like a Gaussian laser beam produces a
		ground-state potential well, in which an atom can be trapped. Figure and 		caption are adopted from \cite{grimm}.}}
	\label{fig:ac_stark} 
\end{figure}
Since the sign of the perturbation is reversed for the excited state, the effect of the detuning becomes opposite, whereby it is important that the atom remains in the ground state. Thus, one has to minimize the scattering with the optical potential. The scattering rate is given as \cite{grimm}
\begin{equation}
	\Gamma_{sc} = \frac{3 \pi c^2}{2 \hbar \omega_{0}^3} \left( \frac{\omega}{\omega_0} \right) ^3 \left( \frac{\Gamma}{\Delta} \right) ^2 I \; .
\end{equation}
As the detuning becomes small, the laser becomes resonant with the atom causing a large increase in scattered photons. Therefore, one has to choose a large detuning in order for the potential to remain conservative. However, this comes at the cost of a weaker potential. To compensate this, a high laser intensity must be used for the potential to reach sufficient depth. In practice there will be a limit to the laser power available, however, for most alkali-metal atoms the detuning is typically chosen to be large compared to the excited-state hyperfine structure splitting, which provides enough depth while being sufficient to suppress scattering events \cite{manybodyBloch}. 


\subsection{Optical Lattices}

The dipole potential in equation \eqref{eq:dipolepot} scales with the intensity of the laser. Thus, superimposing laser beams enables a multitude of different potentials through the interference patterns of the lasers. A standing wave from two counter-propagating light fields will lead to an array of potential wells
\begin{equation}
	V(z) = - V_0 \cos^2{k z } \; ,
	\label{eq:standwave}
\end{equation}
where $V_0 = | \frac{3 \pi c^2}{2 \omega_{0}^3} \frac{\Gamma}{\Delta} 4 I_0 |$ is derived from eq. \eqref{eq:dipolepot}. In practice, the one-dimensional lattice structure of eq. \eqref{eq:standwave} is created by shining a single laser beam at a mirror, whereby it interferes with itself.
\begin{figure}[!h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\columnwidth]{Figures/OpticalLattice.pdf} 
	\caption{\textit{\textbf{(a)} Two dimensional optical lattice formed by two mutually orthogonal laser beams. These tubes have a characteristic cigar shape, due to the Gaussian profile of the lasers. \textbf{(b)} Upon using three orthogonal laser beams, the result is a three dimensional lattice reminiscent of a cubic crystal. Figure is adopted from \cite{WideraThesis}.}}
	\label{fig:OpticalLattice} 
\end{figure}
Adding another standing laser beam in a different direction creates a periodic two dimensional potential. For orthogonal polarization of the two lasers, the resulting potential is purely the sum of the sinusoidal standing wave potential, as no interference term is present \cite{lewenstein}. Note, the lattice is only well defined for distances much smaller than the waist of the laser beams, as the lattice is only present within the overlap of the two beams. Various shapes of the lattice can be achieved by adjusting the angle between the beams, however, the most common setup is using two orthogonal beam creating a square lattice of one dimensional tubes, as seen in figure \ref{fig:OpticalLattice}.
In order to create a three dimensional lattice, as seen in figure \ref{fig:OpticalLattice}, an additional third perpendicular laser beam is needed. In the center of the trap, the lattice potential is then given by
\begin{equation}
	V(x,y,z) = - V_0 \left( \cos^2{k x } + \cos^2{k y } + \cos^2{k z } \right) \; , \label{eq:3Dlattice}
\end{equation}
for distances much smaller than the beam waist. In addition to the lattice, an external harmonic confinement will be present due to the Gaussian profile of the laser beams \cite{manybodyBloch}.

\subsection{Band Structure}
Consider a periodic potential as described by eq. \eqref{eq:standwave}. \textit{Bloch's Theorem} states that energy eigenstates of a periodic potential with lattice vector $\boldsymbol{R}$ and quasi-momentum $\boldsymbol{q}$ can be written as Bloch waves, which take the form
\begin{equation}
	\phi_{\boldsymbol{q}}^{(n)}(\boldsymbol{r}) = e^{i \boldsymbol{q} \boldsymbol{r}} u^{(n)}(\boldsymbol{r}) \; ,
\end{equation}
which is a plane wave modulated by a function with the same periodicity as the potential $u^{(n)}(\boldsymbol{r}) = u^{(n)}(\boldsymbol{r} + \boldsymbol{R})$. Furthermore, the Bloch waves are periodic in reciprocal space, such that $\phi_{\boldsymbol{q}}^{(n)}(\boldsymbol{r}) = \phi_{\boldsymbol{q} + \boldsymbol{G}}^{(n)}(\boldsymbol{r})$, where $\boldsymbol{G}$ is a reciprocal lattice vector \cite{kittel}.
This leads to an energy spectrum in the shape of bands with the periodicity of the first \textit{Brillouin Zone}. Bands are denoted by the band index $n$, and their shape is determined by both the shape and the depth of the potential. The potential depth is often denoted in units of the recoil energy $E_{\mathrm{rec}} = \frac{\hbar ^2 k^2}{2 m}$, where $m$ is the mass of the atom, and $k$ is the photon wave number of the light forming the optical lattice. For $V_0 = 0$, the particles are free, hence the bands will be parabolic. Meanwhile, for $V_0 \rightarrow \infty$, no interaction between different wells of the lattice can take place, as the wavefunctions of the trapped atoms will be confined to their respective well. Thus, the lattice is reduced to an array of independent harmonic oscillators, whereby the bands will appear flat with equal spacing \cite{greiner}. 

\subsection{Localized States}
For lattice potential depths within $5 E_{\mathrm{rec}} \leq V_0 \leq 8 E_{\mathrm{rec}}$, the lattice is in the \textit{tight binding limit}. Within this range the wavefunctions of the trapped atoms will only overlap with other wells in their closest proximity. Thus, interactions between wells are almost purely of nearest neighbour nature. Due to how well localized the wavefunctions are, a basis of Wannier functions is ideal for describing the system. Wannier functions are related to Bloch functions through the Fourier transform \cite{kittel1963}
\begin{equation}
	w^{(n)}(\boldsymbol{r}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N_L}} \sum_{q} e^{ -i \boldsymbol{q} \boldsymbol{R} } \phi_{\boldsymbol{q}}^{(n)}(\boldsymbol{r}) \; ,
\end{equation} 
where $N_L$ is the number of primitive cells of the lattice. The Wannier functions are well localized and centered around the lattice at site $\boldsymbol{R}$. In the case of a separable periodic potential, like that of eq. \eqref{eq:3Dlattice}, the single-particle problem becomes one-dimensional \cite{kohn1959analyticWannier}. Lastly, Wannier functions obey the orthonormality relation
\begin{equation}
	\int \mathrm{d^3}r \; \; w^{(n) *}(\boldsymbol{r} - \boldsymbol{R}) w^{(n')}(\boldsymbol{r} - \boldsymbol{R'}) = \delta_{n,n'} \delta_{\boldsymbol{R},\boldsymbol{R}'} \; ,
\end{equation}
thus forming a complete basis \cite{manybodyBloch}. 
\begin{figure}[!h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{Figures/WannierFunctions.pdf} 
	\caption{\textit{Two one-dimensional Wannier functions plotted for lattice depths of $V_0 = 4.5 E_{\mathrm{rec}}$ \textbf{(a)} and $V_0 = 14 E_{\mathrm{rec}}$ \textbf{(b)} respectively.}}
	\label{fig:WannierPlot} 
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:WannierPlot}.a shows Wannier functions plotted for lattice potential depths within the tight binding limit. As evident from the plot, the functions overlap with only their nearest neighbours. In the case of a more shallow lattice, the functions would extends to further wells, while they will tend towards a Gaussian shape as the lattice depth increases \cite{greiner}, which can be seen in figure \ref{fig:WannierPlot}.b.



\section{Bose-Einstein Condensates}

Bosons are particles of integer spin, whose statistics obey those of a Bose-Einstein distribution
\begin{equation}
	n_i = \frac{g_i}{\exp \left( \left( \varepsilon_i -\mu \right) / k_B T \right) - 1} \; , \label{eq:BHdistribution}
\end{equation} 
where $i$ denotes the state, $n_i$ is the population of the state, $g_i$ is its degeneracy, $\varepsilon_i$ is its energy, $\mu$ is the chemical potential, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature. One important feature of bosons is that, unlike fermions, multiple particles can occupy the same quantum state. At higher temperatures the energy spectrum is practically continues, whereby this property has little effect, as two particles occupying the same single-particle state is highly unlikely. However, at low temperatures the energy spectrum systems become increasingly discrete, hence the statistics of the particles become very important. As evident from eq. \eqref{eq:BHdistribution}, the population of the ground state diverges as $T \to 0$. However, even below a finite temperature, $T_c$, one will observe a macroscopic population of the ground state. $T_c$ is called the critical temperature, and marks the point where multiple particles will start forming a Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC). \cite{pethick2002bose}

\subsection{Non-Interacting Particles}
In the case of non-interacting particles and zero temperature, all particles of a Bose gas can be described by identical single-particles wavefunctions $\phi (\boldsymbol{r}_i)$. Hence, the many-body wavefunction is simply given by the product 
\begin{equation}
	\Psi (\boldsymbol{r}_1 , \ldots , \boldsymbol{r}_N) = \prod_{i}^{N} \phi (\boldsymbol{r}_i) \; .
\end{equation}
Such a product state can be described by a single macroscopic wavefunction
\begin{equation}
	\psi (\boldsymbol{r}) = \sqrt{N} \varphi (\boldsymbol{r}) \; , \label{eq:psi_NIBEC}
\end{equation}
where $\phi (\boldsymbol{r})$ is the wave function of the single-particle state, in which the bosons condensate into \cite{PenroseOnsager}.

\subsubsection{Second-Quantization}
When describing Bose-Einstein condensates it is very convenient to work in second quantization, which describes the number of particle in each state rather than the state of each particle.\\
First, consider a basis of single particle states $\{ \ket{n} \}$, namely a Fock basis. In this space particles are created or annihilated through their respective operators
\begin{equation}
	\hat{a}_{\mu}^{\dag} \ket{0}_\mu = \ket{1}_\mu \; .
\end{equation}
For bosons the creation and annihilation operators fulfill the commutation relations
\begin{equation}
[\hat{a}_\nu,\hat{a}_\mu]=[\hat{a}_\nu^\dagger,\hat{a}_\mu^\dagger]=0 \quad , \quad [\hat{a}_\nu,\hat{a}_\mu^\dagger]=\delta_{\nu,\mu} \; , 
\end{equation}
with the number operator given as
\begin{equation}
	\hat{n}_{\mu} = \hat{a}_{\mu}^{\dag} \hat{a}_{\mu} \; .
\end{equation}
In second quantization many-body states are described by the occupation of the individual Fock states. Thus, a creation operator will raise the number of particles in its corresponding state by one, while the annihilation operator will lower it:
\begin{align}
\hat{a}_{_\nu}^\dagger \ket{N_0,N_1, \ldots , N_{\nu},\ldots}&= \sqrt{N_\nu+1}\ket{N_0,N_1, \ldots , N_{\nu}+1,\ldots} \\
\hat{a}_{_\nu} \ket{N_0,N_1, \ldots , N_{\nu},\ldots}&= \sqrt{N_\nu}\ket{N_0,N_1, \ldots , N_{\nu}-1,\ldots} .
\end{align}
Likewise, the number operator $\hat{n}_{\mu}$ will count the number of particles in its corresponding state. These operators can be combined with an orthonormal basis of spatial wavefunctions $\{ \phi_k \}$ in order to create field operators
\begin{equation}
	\hat{\psi}(\boldsymbol{r}) = \; \sum_{k} \phi_k (\boldsymbol{r}) \hat{a}_{k} \quad , \quad \hat{\psi}^{\dag}(\boldsymbol{r}) = \; \sum_{k} \phi_{k}^{*} (\boldsymbol{r}) \hat{a}_{k}^{\dag} \; ,
\end{equation}
where $\hat{\psi}^{\dagger}(\boldsymbol{r})$ will create a particle at location $\boldsymbol{r}$. For bosons the field operators fulfill the commutation relations \cite{bruus}
\begin{equation}
	\left[ \hat{\psi}(\boldsymbol{r}) \; , \; \hat{\psi}^{\dag}(\boldsymbol{r'}) \right] = \; \delta^3(\boldsymbol{r} - \boldsymbol{r}') \quad , \quad
	\left[ \hat{\psi}(\boldsymbol{r}) \; , \; \hat{\psi}(\boldsymbol{r'}) \right] = \; 0 \; .
\end{equation}
Now, consider a gas of non-interacting bosons described by eq. \eqref{eq:psi_NIBEC}, where $\epsilon_k$ is the energy of the $k$'th single-particle state. Due to the completeness of the basis of single-particle wavefunctions, $\{ \phi_k \}$, the creation operator can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
	\hat{a}_{k}^{\dagger} = \int \mathrm{d^3} r \;  \phi_{k}^*(\boldsymbol{r}) \hat{\psi}^{\dagger}(\boldsymbol{r}) \; .
\end{equation}
Thereby the non-interacting Hamiltonian can be written as
\begin{align}
	\hat{H}^{(0)} =& \; \sum_{k} \epsilon_k \hat{a}_{k}^{\dag} \hat{a}_{k} \nonumber \\
		=& \;  \sum_{k} \int \mathrm{d^3}r_1 \mathrm{d^3}r_2 \; \epsilon_k \phi_k (\boldsymbol{r_2}) \phi_{k}^* (\boldsymbol{r_1})\;  \hat{\psi}^{\dag} (\boldsymbol{r_1}) \hat{\psi} (\boldsymbol{r_2}) \nonumber \\
		=& \; \int \mathrm{d^3}r  \; \hat{\psi}^{\dag}(\boldsymbol{r}) \left( - \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \nabla^2 + U(\boldsymbol{r})\right) \hat{\psi}(\boldsymbol{r}) \; ,
		\label{hamil2nd}
\end{align}
where the orthonormality of the wavefunctions
\begin{equation}
	\sum_{k}  \phi_k (\boldsymbol{r_2}) \phi_{k}^* (\boldsymbol{r_1}) = \delta^3(\boldsymbol{r_1} - \boldsymbol{r_2})
\end{equation} 
has been utilized.

\subsection{Weakly Interacting Particles}
A characteristic of a BEC is its low temperature and density. Thus, is it a valid approximation to only consider two-particle interactions
\begin{equation}
	\hat{H}^{(2)} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \neq j} V(\boldsymbol{r_i} - \boldsymbol{r_j}) \; .
\end{equation}
At low energies all interactions can be considered of s-wave nature, because waves of higher angular momentum are reflected by the centrifugal barrier. Furthermore, the thermal de Broglie wavelength for cold gases is much larger than the effective extension of the interaction potential. Therefore, the actual shape of the scattering potential is irrelevant, whereby one can replace it with a pseudo-potential
\begin{equation}
	V(\boldsymbol{r} - \boldsymbol{r'}) = g \; \delta^3(\boldsymbol{r} - \boldsymbol{r'}) = \frac{4 \pi \hbar^2 a}{m} \delta^3(\boldsymbol{r} - \boldsymbol{r'}) \; ,
\end{equation}
which results in the same scattering phase as the real, more complicated scattering potential. Thus, the interaction of cold atoms is fully determined by the scattering length, $a$ \cite{greiner}.\\
Introducing the density operator
\begin{equation}
	\hat{\rho}(\boldsymbol{r}) = \hat{\psi}^{\dag}(\boldsymbol{r}) \hat{\psi}(\boldsymbol{r}) \; ,
\end{equation}
allows writing $\hat{H}^{(2)}$ in second quantization
\begin{align}
	\hat{H}^{(2)} &= \frac{1}{2} \int \mathrm{d^3}r_1 \mathrm{d^3}r_2 V(\boldsymbol{r_1} - \boldsymbol{r_2}) \hat{\psi}^{\dag}(\boldsymbol{r_1}) \hat{\psi}(\boldsymbol{r_1}) \left( \hat{\psi}^{\dag}(\boldsymbol{r_2}) \hat{\psi}(\boldsymbol{r_2}) - \delta(\boldsymbol{r_1} - \boldsymbol{r_2}) \right) \nonumber \\
	&= \frac{1}{2} \int \mathrm{d^3}r_1 \mathrm{d^3}r_2  \hat{\psi}^{\dag}(\boldsymbol{r_1}) \hat{\psi}^{\dag}(\boldsymbol{r_2}) V(\boldsymbol{r_1} - \boldsymbol{r_2}) \hat{\psi}(\boldsymbol{r_1}) \hat{\psi}(\boldsymbol{r_2}) \; .
\end{align}
Combining this with the basic Hamiltonian of equation \eqref{hamil2nd}, gives the full Hamiltonian in second quantization
\begin{align}
	\hat{H} &= \hat{H}^{(0)} + \hat{H}^{(2)} \\
	& = \int \mathrm{d^3}r \ \hat{\psi}^{\dag}(\boldsymbol{r}) \left( - \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \nabla^2 + U(\boldsymbol{r})\right) \hat{\psi}(\boldsymbol{r}) \nonumber \\
	 & \quad + \frac{1}{2} \int \mathrm{d^3}r_1 \mathrm{d^3}r_2  \ \hat{\psi}^{\dag}(\boldsymbol{r_1}) \hat{\psi}^{\dag}(\boldsymbol{r_2}) V(\boldsymbol{r_1} - \boldsymbol{r_2}) \hat{\psi}(\boldsymbol{r_1}) \hat{\psi}(\boldsymbol{r_2})
	\label{hamilint}
\end{align}
Solving the Heisenberg equations of motion using the field description of the Hamiltonian leads to
\begin{equation}
	i \hbar \frac{\partial }{\partial t} \hat{\psi}(\boldsymbol{r}) = \left[ \hat{\psi}(\boldsymbol{r}) \; , \; \hat{H}  \right] = \left( - \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \nabla^2 + U(\boldsymbol{r}) + g \hat{\psi}^{\dag}(\boldsymbol{r}) \hat{\psi}(\boldsymbol{r}) \right) \hat{\psi}(\boldsymbol{r}) \; ,
\end{equation}
which is not analytically solvable. However, if the scattering length $a$ is much less than the mean inter-particle distance, such that $n a^3 \ll 1$, where $n$ is the density of the gas, the mean-field approximation is viable
\begin{equation}
	\hat{\psi}(\boldsymbol{r}) = \psi(\boldsymbol{r}) + \delta \hat{\psi}(\boldsymbol{r}) \; ,
\end{equation}
where $\psi(\boldsymbol{r})$ is the mean-field given by eq. \eqref{eq:psi_NIBEC}, and $\delta \hat{\psi}(\boldsymbol{r})$ is fluctuations from the mean. If $\braket{\delta \hat{\psi}(\boldsymbol{r})} = 0$, the fluctuations can be neglected, leading to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation \cite{Gross1961,Pitaevskii}
\begin{equation}
	i \hbar \frac{\partial }{\partial t} \hat{\psi}(\boldsymbol{r}) = \left( - \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \nabla^2 + U(\boldsymbol{r}) + g |\psi(\boldsymbol{r})|^2 \right) \psi(\boldsymbol{r}) \; .
\end{equation}
The Gross-Pitaevskii equation is very similar to the Schrödinger equation with exception of the non-linear term $g |\psi(\boldsymbol{r})|^2$, which can make the equation hard to solve in regions of low density.



\section{Bose-Hubbard Model of Interacting Bosons in a Lattice} \label{sec:BHmodel}
The Bose-Hubbard model describes weakly interacting bosons in a periodic lattice within the tight binding limit. The model is perfectly capable of predicting results with good accuracy, however, two conditions must hold in order for it to be valid: (i) both the thermal energy and the mean interaction energy at a single site must be much smaller than the separation to first excited band, $\hbar \omega_0$, and (ii) the Wannier functions decay essentially within the length of the lattice constant \cite{manybodyBloch}.
Under these conditions one is assured that only the lowest band is taken into account, and that only nearest-neighbour interactions take place.

The Bose-Hubbard model is interesting, as it supports two distinct phases: the Superfluid phase and the Mott-Insulator phase. Furthermore, the model contains effects such as a quantum phase transition between the two phases mentioned above, which can be crossed without any change in external parameters.
While crossing the critical point a state experiences a variety of quantum phenomena, which have great implications for the dynamics of the system.


\subsection{The Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian}
Consider the Hamiltonian for bosonic particles in a trapping potential in one dimension as described by eq. \eqref{hamilint}. For a periodic lattice potential in the tight binding limit it is favourable to work in a basis of localized Wannier functions. Expanding the field operators of the Hamiltonian in eq. \eqref{hamilint} in  the Wannier basis yields \cite{Jaksch}
\begin{align}
	\hat{H} &= \int \mathrm{d}x \sum_{i j} w^*(x-x_i) \hat{a}_{i}^{\dag} \left( - \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \nabla ^2 + V(x) \right) w(x-x_j) \hat{a}_j \nonumber \\
	& \quad + g \int \mathrm{d}x \sum_{i j k l} w^*(x-x_i) w^*(x-x_j) w(x-x_k) w(x-x_l) \hat{a}_{i}^{\dag} \hat{a}_{j}^{\dag} \hat{a}_{k} \hat{a}_{l} \\
	&= - \sum_{i j } J_{i j} \hat{a}_{i}^{\dag} \hat{a}_{j} + \sum_{i j k l} U_{i j k l} \hat{a}_{i}^{\dag} \hat{a}_{j}^{\dag} \hat{a}_{k} \hat{a}_{l} \; ,
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
	J_{i j} &= - \int \mathrm{d}x \ w^*(x-x_i) \left( - \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \nabla ^2 + V(x) \right) w(x-x_j) \label{eq:BHparamJ} \\
	U_{i j k l} &= g \int \mathrm{d}x \ w^*(x-x_i) w^*(x-x_j) w(x-x_k) w(x-x_l) 
\end{align}
Since the system is periodic, one can consider a single site, $i = 0$, as representative for the entire lattice. In this way, the different terms of the Hamiltonian can be interpreted as follows:
\begin{align}
	J_{0 0} &= \text{constant energy offset} \nonumber \\
	J_{0 1} &= \text{"overlap matrix element" to neighbouring site} \nonumber \\
	J_{0 2 - 0 \infty} &= \text{"overlap matrix element" to further sites} \nonumber \\
	U_{0 0 0 0} &= \text{on-site interaction for two particles} \nonumber \\
	U_{0 i i 0} &= \text{interaction off-site} \nonumber \\
	U_{0 0 0 1} &= \text{interaction  + tunnelling , off-site} \nonumber 
\end{align}
Due to the rapid decay of the Wannier functions, the overlap of wavefunctions is limited to their nearest neighbour. Dropping all exponentially suppressed terms and constant offsets yields the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
	\hat{H} = - J \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \hat{a}_{i}^{\dag} \hat{a}_{j} + \frac{U}{2} \sum_{i} \hat{n}_i \left( \hat{n}_i -1 \right) + \sum_{i} \varepsilon_i \hat{n}_i \; ,
	\label{BHhamil}
\end{equation}
where $J = J_{0 1}$, the bracket $\langle i,j \rangle$ denotes only counting neighbouring pairs, and
\begin{equation}
	U = U_{0 0 0 0} = g \int \mathrm{d}x \ |w(x)|^4 \; .
	\label{eq:BHparamU}
\end{equation}
The first term of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian describes the kinematics within the model, which takes the form of tunneling between neighbouring sites. This is interpreted by annihilating a particle at site $j$ while creating a particle at site $i$. The second term describes the interaction between particles within a single site, and the last term $\sum_{i} \varepsilon_i \hat{n}_i$ takes into account a possible potential offset at different sites.

\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:UJparameters} illustrates the parameters of the Bose-Hubbard model as function of the lattice depth. The tunneling matrix element falls of very quickly with increasing lattice depth, as the Wannier functions become localized to their respective wells, thus reducing their overlap. The localization of the Wannier functions also causes the on-site interaction strength to increase.

\subsection{Phases of the Bose-Hubbard Model}

The Bose-Hubbard model supports two quantum phases: The \textit{superfluid} phase and the \textit{Mott-Insulator} phase. These phases depend on the ratio $J/U$, and can be described separately by examining the ground state of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian in the two extreme limits of the $J/U$ ratio.

\subsubsection{Superfluid Phase}
For a system where the tunneling matrix element $J$ is dominant, the lowest energy is obtained by delocalizing the atoms over the entire lattice. Thereby the wavefunction will be a product over single-particle states, and the system will be a superfluid \cite{greiner}.\\
Consider the case of negligible interactions and a lattice with wells of equal depth. In this scenario the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian reduces to
\begin{equation}
	\hat{H} = \hat{H}_J = - J \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \hat{a}_{i}^{\dag} \hat{a}_{j} \; , 
	\label{hamilSF}
\end{equation}
which is completely periodic within the lattice due to the lack of site specific terms. This leads to solutions in the shape of Bloch waves. The Fourier transform of the annihilation and creation operators reads
\begin{equation}
	\hat{a}_j = \frac{1}{L} \sum_{q}  e^{i q x_j} \hat{a}_q \quad , \quad
	\hat{a}_{j}^{\dag} = \frac{1}{L} \sum_{q}  e^{-i q x_j} \hat{a}_{q}^{\dag} \; ,
\end{equation}
where $L$ is the number of sites in the lattice. Through the Fourier transform the Hamiltonian \eqref{hamilSF} can be expressed in momentum space
\begin{equation}
	\hat{H}_J = - J \sum_{q = - \infty}^{\infty} \left( e^{- i q d } + e^{i q d} \right) \hat{n}_q \; ,
\end{equation}
where $d$ is the lattice distance. In momentum space the Hamiltonian is diagonal and has a continuous energy spectrum
\begin{equation}
	E_q = -2 J \cos(q d) \; .
	\label{SFenergy}
\end{equation}
Thus, the excitation spectrum of the superfluid is said to be gapless. The lowest energy is of the system is obtained for $q = 0$, whereby the ground state is
\begin{equation}
	\ket{\Psi_{SF}} =  \frac{1}{\sqrt{N_{p} !}} \left( \hat{a}_{q = 0}^{\dag} \right) ^{N_{p}} \ket{0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N_{p} !}} \left( \frac{1}{L} \sum_{j = 1}^{L} \hat{a}_{j}^{\dag} \right) ^{N_{p}} \ket{0} \; ,
\end{equation} 
where $N_{p}$ is the number of particles. This state supports a well defined macroscopic phase on each lattice site, since the many-body state is a product over identical single-particle states \cite{greiner}. With all particle condensed into the $q = 0$ momentum space state, the particles are completely de-localized in real space, which can be seen by taking the Fourier transform. For large $N_{p} , L \rightarrow \infty$ at fixed density $N_{p}/L$ the state becomes indistinguishable from having coherent states, $\ket{\alpha} $, on all lattice sites \cite{manybodyBloch}. Since bosonic operators at different sites commute, the superfluid state can be factorized into a product of local coherent states
\begin{equation}
	\ket{\Psi_{SF}} \approx \prod_j \left( e^{\sqrt{N_p/L} \hat{a}_{j}^{\dag}} \right) \ket{0} = \ket{\alpha_1} \otimes \ket{\alpha_2} \otimes \ldots
	\label{stateSF}
\end{equation}
\begin{figure}[!h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{Figures/f(n)_SF.JPG} 
	\caption{\textbf{(a)}The statistics for the number of particles per lattice site $n$ for a filling fraction of $\bar{n}=1$ and $\bar{n}=2$ in the superfluid phase. \textbf{(b)} Illustration of the particles in the lattice. There will be large fluctuations of the number of particles found at each lattice site at a given time. Figure and caption adopted from \cite{greiner}.}
	\label{fig:f(n)_SF} 
\end{figure}
Coherent states are eigenstates of the annihilation operator $\hat{a} \ket{\alpha} = \alpha \ket{\alpha}$, where $|\alpha |^2$ can be considered the particle density of the system, and $\alpha = |\alpha| e^{i \phi}$, with $\phi$ being a global phase. Utilizing the coherent state form of the wavefunction \eqref{stateSF} the average filling fraction $\bar{n}$ can be calculated
\begin{equation}
	\bar{n} = \braket{\hat{n}_i} = \bra{\Psi_{SF}} \hat{a}_{j}^{\dag} \hat{a}_{j} \ket{\Psi_{SF}} = \frac{N_p}{L} \; ,
\end{equation}
as well as the fluctuations of particle number per site
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\sqrt{\Delta \bar{n}^2}}{\bar{n}} \sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{\bar{n}}} \; .
\end{equation}
Therefore, the probability distribution for the number of atoms at a given site is Poissonian, which can be seen in figure \ref{fig:f(n)_SF}. Due to the relatively large fluctuation of particle number per site, one would find a somewhat random number of atoms at a given site in a single measurement. However, averaging over many measurements well produce the filling fraction $\bar{n}$. In the presence of a finite interaction the resulting distribution would be sub Poissonian due to number squeezing \cite{greiner}.


\subsubsection{Mott-Insulator Phase}
In the case of negligible tunneling only the on-site interaction between the atoms has to be taken into account, and the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian reduces to
\begin{equation}
	\hat{H} = \hat{H}_U = \frac{U}{2} \sum_{i} \hat{n}_i \left( \hat{n}_i -1 \right) \; ,
	\label{hamilMott}
\end{equation}
which is quadratic in $\hat{n}_i$. This heavily penalizes having multiple particles at the same site. Thus, the ground state of the system will be an equal distribution of all the particles throughout the lattice. Any fluctuations from this average will increase the energy, whereby the phase is said to be incompressible \cite{Gemelke2009}. This incompressibility can be formulated as $\partial n / \partial \mu = 0$, where $\mu$ is the chemical potential, and is the defining property of the Mott-Insulator \cite{manybodyBloch}.\\
\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{Figures/f(n)_M.JPG} 
\caption{\textbf{(a)}The statistics for the number of particles per lattice site $n$ in the Mott-insulator phase, for a filling fraction of $\bar{n}=1$ and $\bar{n}=2$. \textbf{(b)} Illustration of the particles in the lattice. The particles does not hop around in the lattice and are equally distributed. Caption and figure are adapted from \cite{greiner}.}
\label{fig:f(n)_M} 
\end{figure}
Consider the case of average filling of one particle per site, $\bar{n} = 1$. The many-body state can be described by a product of single particles located on each site \cite{manybodyBloch}
\begin{equation}
	\ket{\Psi_{Mott}} = \prod_j \hat{a}_{j}^{\dag} \ket{0} \; .
	\label{eq:MIstate}
\end{equation}
Eq. \ref{eq:MIstate} is a simple product of local Fock states with precisely one atom per site, which is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:f(n)_M}. This configuration of atoms minimizes the energy with regards to the Hamiltonian of eq. \eqref{hamilMott}. Any fluctuation from unit occupancy will increase the energy, as merely a single double occupancy will increase the energy by $U$. Thereby, unlike the energy spectrum of the Superfluid, the Mott-Insulator spectrum is gapped. As long as the gain in kinetic energy due to hopping, $J$, is smaller than the on-site interaction, $U$, the atoms remain localized. However, for $J > 0$ the ground state is no longer the product state described in eq. \eqref{eq:MIstate} \cite{manybodyBloch}. As $J$ increases, the gap in the excitation spectrum will gradually decrease until the transition to the superfluid is reached and the spectrum becomes gapless.\\
While the Mott-Insulator phase has complete localization, the phases on the individual sites have obtained maximum uncertainty. Therefore, no phase coherence between different sites is present \cite{greiner}.


\subsection{Mean-Field Approximation of Phase Diagram}
Consider once again the full Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian \eqref{BHhamil}. The superfluid and the Mott-Insulator account for the two limits of the ratio $J/U$. However, in order to understand the full phase diagram of the Bose-Hubbard model, one has to derive the critical fraction $(J/U)_{crit}$ for which the phase transition occurs. There are several ways of doing this - one of them is looking at a mean-field solution of the Bose-Hubbard model. For simplicity the zero temperature case is treated here. Even without a change of temperature the phase transition still happens, hence it is referred to as a \textit{quantum phase transition}, since the phase transition can happen without change of external parameters \cite{Sachdev2007QPT}.\\
Applying the mean field approximation to the annihilation operator yields
\begin{equation}
	\hat{a}_j = \psi + \delta \hat{a}_j \; ,
\end{equation}
where $\psi$ is the locally constant mean field, and $\delta \hat{a}_j$ is the fluctuation term. Inserting this into the Hamiltonian yields
\begin{equation}
	\hat{H}_{MF} = -J \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \left( \psi^* + \delta \hat{a}_{i}^{\dag} \right) \left( \psi + \delta \hat{a}_{j} \right) + \text{int.}
\end{equation}
Instead of considering the Hamiltonian as a whole, it can be considered as a sum of local on-site Hamiltonians
\begin{equation}
	\hat{H}_{MF} = \sum_{i} \hat{h}_i \; .
\end{equation}
For a homogeneous system one can express the kinetic part of the Hamiltonian locally if only small fluctuations from the mean field are assumed
\begin{align}
  \hat{a}_{i}^{\dag} \hat{a}_{j} &= \left( \psi^* + \delta \hat{a}_{i}^{\dag} \right) \left( \psi + \delta \hat{a}_{j} \right) \nonumber \\
  &= \psi^* \psi + \psi^* \delta \hat{a}_j + \psi \delta \hat{a}_{i}^{\dag} + \delta \hat{a}_{i}^{\dag} \delta \hat{a}_{j} \nonumber \\
  & \approx \psi^* \psi + \psi^* \left( \hat{a}_j - \psi \right) + \psi \left( \hat{a}_{i}^{\dag} - \psi^* \right) \nonumber \\
&= \psi^* \hat{a}_j + \psi \hat{a}_{i}^{\dag} - \psi^* \psi \; .
\end{align}
Since every term only contains a single index, one can let $j \rightarrow i$ leaving a local description
\begin{equation}
	\hat{h}_i = J z \psi^* \psi - J z \left( \psi^* \hat{a}_i + \psi \hat{a}_{i}^{\dag} \right) + \frac{U}{2} \hat{n}_i \left( \hat{n}_i -1 \right) + \mu_i \hat{n}_i \; ,
	\label{localhamil}
\end{equation}
where $z$ is the number of neighbours of site $i$ \cite{vanoosten}. The last term added is a chemical potential, which is needed due to the lack of a fixed local particle number prompting the use of a Grand Canonical Ensemble description.

Landau theory is a general theory regarding phase transitions, which states that in the vicinity of a critical point, one may expand the free energy in a power series of some order parameter. Thus, in order to find $(J/U)_{crit}$, eq. \eqref{localhamil} must be minimized. here, the order parameter is the mean field, hence
\begin{equation}
	E_{MF} = \text{const. } + a |\psi|^2 + b |\psi|^4 + \ldots \label{eq:landau}
\end{equation} 
Eq. \eqref{eq:landau} constitutes an effective potential, which dictates certain properties of the system.
The potential is symmetric in the complex plane allowing the system to have any phase. Furthermore, at some critical value of $a$, (here $a = 0$), the potential will shift from having a single central minimum to having minima at some finite $|\psi|$. This is a U(1) spontaneous symmetry breaking, which in Landau theory is associated with a phase transition \cite{plischke}. Thus, one need to compute the parameter $a$ of equation \eqref{eq:landau}.\\
One method is using second order perturbation theory, where the $\hat{\psi} = 0$ case is solved exactly, followed by adding a small $\hat{\psi}$ as a perturbation. The zeroth order of the local mean-field Hamiltonian reads
\begin{equation}
	\hat{h}_{i}^{(0)} = J z \left( \psi^* \psi \right) + \frac{U}{2} \hat{n}_i \left( \hat{n}_i -1 \right) - \mu \hat{n}_i \; .
\end{equation} 
Since the zero-order solution only contains number operators, the ground state of the solution can be expressed in the Fock basis:
\begin{align*}
	\ket{0} \quad &\text{for} \quad \mu < 0 \\
	\ket{1} \quad &\text{for} \quad 0 \leq \mu < U \\
	\ket{2} \quad &\text{for} \quad U \leq \mu < 2 U \\
	& \vdots
\end{align*} 
The first order perturbation to the energy vanishes, as
\begin{equation}
	E_{i}^{(1)} = \bra{n} \delta \hat{a}_i \ket{n} = 0 \; ,
\end{equation}
Thus, the use of a second order perturbation is required
\begin{equation}
	E_{i}^{(2)} = \sum_{n \neq m} \frac{|\bra{n} \delta \hat{h}_i \ket{m}|^2}{E_{m}^{(0)} - E_{n}^{(0)}} \; .
\end{equation}
Here the perturbation Hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
	\hat{h}_i = - z J \left( \hat{a}_i \psi^* + \psi \hat{a}_{i}^{\dag} \right)
\end{equation}
contains only single creation/annihilation operators, whereby
\begin{equation}
	\bra{n} \delta \hat{h}_i \ket{m} = 0 \quad \text{for} \quad |n - m| \neq 1 \; .
\end{equation}
Hence, only off-diagonal matrix elements contribute to the perturbation
\begin{align*}
	\bra{n}  \hat{a}_{i}^{\dag} \ket{n-1} &= \sqrt{n} \braket{n|n} \\
	\bra{n+1}  \hat{a}_{i}^{\dag} \ket{n} &= \sqrt{n+1} \braket{n|n} \\
	& \vdots
\end{align*}
Thereby, the second order perturbation energy reduces to
\begin{align}
	E_{i}^{(2)} &= \left( J z \right)^2 |\psi|^2 \left( \frac{n}{E_{g}^{(0)}- E_{n-1}^{(0)}} +  \frac{n+1}{E_{n}^{(0)}- E_{n+1}^{(0)}} \right) \nonumber \\
	&= \left( J z \right)^2 |\psi|^2 \left( \frac{n}{U(n-1) - \mu} + \frac{n+1}{\mu - U n} \right) \; .
\end{align}
From eq. \eqref{eq:landau} $a$ is the pre-factor of all terms proportional $|\psi|^2$. Collecting those across from all the perturbations yields the approximation 
\begin{equation}
	a = J z + \left( J z \right)^2 |\psi|^2 \left( \frac{n}{U(n-1) - \mu} + \frac{n+1}{\mu - U n} \right) \; .
\end{equation} 
As stated earlier $(J/U)_{crit}$ can be found at the point where $a = 0$, hence
\begin{equation}
	0 \overset{!}{=} 1 + \frac{n}{\bar{U} (n-1) - \bar{\mu}} + \frac{n+1}{\bar{\mu} - \bar{U} n} \; ,
\end{equation}
with $\bar{\mu} = \frac{\mu}{J z}$ and $\bar{U} = \frac{U}{J z}$. Finally, the solution for the chemical potential is \cite{vanoosten}
\begin{equation}
	\bar{\mu}_{\pm} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \bar{U}(2n -1) \pm \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\bar{U}^2 - 2 \bar{U} (2 n +1)} \right) \; .
\end{equation}
A better understanding of the results can be obtained by examining figure \ref{fig:SFMOTT}, which displays a phase diagram of the Bose-Hubbard model.  
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width = 0.5\textwidth]{Figures/SFMottPhase.pdf}
	\label{fig:SFMOTT}
	\caption{\textit{Phase diagram of Bose-Hubbard model for T = 0. Grey areas mark the Mott-Insulator phase for different number of particles per site, while white regions mark the superfluid phase. \cite{greiner}}}
\end{figure}
The $\mu_{\pm}$ curves encloses the region where the system is in the Mott-Insulating phase. $(1/\bar{U})_{crit} = (J/U)_{crit}$ can be read off the graph from the point where the two curves $\mu_{\pm}$ meet. No fluctuations take place in the Mott Insulator, whereby the particle number per site is well defined. As the chemical potential increases each site can accommodate more particles as long as the increase in chemical potential compensates the increased energy due to interactions between the particles.

The mean-field solution of the Bose-Hubbard model is only an approximation, which proves quite inaccurate for one dimension. This is obvious when comparing the critical ratio for the mean-field approach, $\left( U/J \right)_{crit}^{MF,1D} = 11.66$, with numerical results computed using the DMRG method, $\left( U/J \right)_{crit}^{DMRG,1D} = 3.37$, \cite{Kuhner2000}. Nevertheless, the mean-field gives a good intuitive feeling of the physics taking place and how one can describe them without resorting to diagonalizing the Hamiltonian.


\section{Non-Equilibirum Dynamics near Critical Points}
The standard procedure for experimentally preparing a Mott-insulator is condensing a gas of cold bosons into a shallow lattice, which effectively forms a superfluid in an equilibrium state. The lattice depth is then slowly ramped up, thereby changing the fraction $U/J$ and driving the phase transition to the Mott \cite{manybodyBloch,Greiner2002}. The constant change of a parameter can be considered a continuous quench of the initial state, whereby the system exhibit out-of-equilibrium dynamics.

This section briefly covers some of the phenomena emerging when crossing a second order phase (continuous) transition like that of the Bose-Hubbard model. The goal is not to provide a full description of these phenomena but rather to illustrate some of the challenges associated with dynamically crossing the critical point.

\subsection{Breakdown of Adiabaticity}
Many experimental procedures rely on adiabaticity for state preparation. The adiabatic theorem in quantum mechanics state that under slow enough external perturbations, no transitions between energy levels take place. For systems with an energy gap between the ground and excited states this is particularly useful, as the ground state can only being excited through the Landau-Zener mechanism \cite{Landau1932,Zener1932} under small perturbations. Thus, state transfers can be achieved adiabatically in gapped systems. In most many-body systems the distance is exponentially small, whereby the time-scale of an adiabatic parameter variation grows exponentially large \cite{Polkovnikov2008}. The one-dimensional superfluid phase is gapless, whereby the energy spectrum is continuous. Therefore, any change in the parameters of a superfluid ground state will results in excitations in the form of Bogoliubov quasi-particles \cite{Polkovnikov2008,Ozeri2005}.
Furthermore, in the vicinity of a critical point the relaxation time-scale of the system diverges, which is known as the \textit{critical slowing down} \cite{Zurek2005}.

Thus, adibadicity is bound to break down when transitioning from a superfluid to a Mott-insulating state by varying the fraction $U/J$. However, changes of parameters are often still referred to as "adiabatic" if they are sufficiently slow compared to the natural time scales of the systems.

\subsection{The Kibble-Zurek Mechanism}
The Kible-Zurek theory describes the emergence of topological defect following a quench through a second-order (continuous) phase transition \cite{Zurek2005}.\\
Consider a system in equilibrium described by a correlation length $\xi$. In the vicinity of a critical point the correlation length diverges as a power law
\begin{equation}
	\xi  \approx \xi_0 |\epsilon (t)|^{-\nu} \quad , \; \epsilon > 0 \; ,
\end{equation} 
where $\nu$ is a static critical exponent, and $\epsilon$ is a reduced coupling, which is zero at the critical point. Thus, near the critical point the equilibrium state is characterized by an infinite correlation length.\\
Assume a state initially in equilibrium begin evolved towards the critical point \cite{Kibble1976}.  
Approaching a second-order phase transition, an equilibrium state can have a relaxation time-scale, $\tau$, which diverges according to
\begin{equation}
	\tau \approx \tau_0 |\epsilon (t)|^{-\mu} \quad , \; \epsilon > 0 \; ,
\end{equation}
near the critical point \cite{Zurek2005}. Here, the parameter $\mu$ is another critical exponent. This divergence of the response time of the state referred to as the \textit{critical slowing down} and causes an inevitable breakdown of adibaticity. As the relaxation time becomes larger than the time before reaching the transition, the systems effectively enters a "freeze-out" period, in which the correlation length no longer can evolve. Thus, the system crosses the critical point without $\xi$ ever having spanned the entire system, which results in the formation of broken-symmetry phase domains, or defects, with independent values of the underlying order parameter \cite{Gillman2018}. This phenomenon is known as the Kibble-Zurek mechanism.
In the context of the Bose-Hubbard model, the Kibble-Zurek mechanism is dependent on the direction of the phase transition, due the completely different energy spectra of the phases. While the transition from the gapped Mott-insulating state to a superfluid will produce topological defects, the opposite transition will amplify the quantum fluctuations of the initial state. Thus, the number-fluctuations of the initial superfluid state may carry over to the Mott-insulator, however, the magnitude of these fluctuations will depend on the exact form of the parameter variation \cite{Schutzhold2006}.


\subsection{Light-Cone Propagation of Correlations}
An important phenomenon for understanding non-equilibrium dynamics of local Hamiltonian models is the light-cone-like propagation of information within the system \cite{Eisert2015}. The effective light-cone limits the speed at which a system can respond to sudden changes in the Hamiltonian and is therefore important when considering the dynamical crossing of a phase transition.
While the existence of light-cones in relativistic quantum field theories is well known, no strict light-cone behavior is is present in general, non-relativistic quantum systems. However, for quantum systems evolving according to a local Hamiltonian, the propagation velocity of information is limited according to the Lieb-Robinson bounds \cite{Lieb1972}.\\ 
Consider a general lattice system with the local Hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
	\hat{H} (t) = \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \hat{h}_{ij}(t) \; ,
\end{equation}
where $\langle \LargerCdot , \LargerCdot \rangle$ denotes nearest-neighbour sites. For two non-overlapping blocks of the lattice $A$, $B$ the Lieb-Robinson bound makes a statement about the operator norm of the commutator
of any operators $\hat{O}_A$ and $\hat{O}_B$ in regions $A$, $B$ taken at
different times
\begin{equation}
	\left\lVert \left[ \hat{O}_A (t) , \hat{O}_B (0) \right] \right\rVert \leq c \lVert \hat{O}_A \rVert \; \lVert \hat{O}_B \rVert
	\min \left( | \hat{O}_A | , | \hat{O}_B | \right) \exp \left(-  \frac{L - v |t|}{\gamma} \right) \; ,
	\label{eq:LiebRobinsonBound}
\end{equation}
where $L$ is the distance between $A$ and $B$, and $| A |$, $| B |$ denote the size (number of sites) in each block \cite{Bravyi2006}. The positive constants $c,v,\lambda > 0$ are determined by the maximum norm of the local Hamiltonians $\max_{\langle i,j \rangle} \max_{t}  \lVert \hat{h}_{ij} (t) \rVert $ and are therefore system dependent. The time-dependent operator norm of the commutator can be considered a measurement of correlated information separated in space and time, and it is effectively bound by the light-cone emerging from the exponential term of eq. \eqref{eq:LiebRobinsonBound}.
A complete understanding of time-dependent Lieb-Robinson bound \eqref{eq:LiebRobinsonBound} is outside the scope of this thesis, however, two remarkable consequences regarding the spreading of information can be inferred from the bound: (i) information propagating outside the light-cone is exponentially suppressed \cite{Bravyi2006}, and (ii) correlations within the system is mediated through entangled quasi-particles \cite{Cheneau2012}, whose ballistic propagation velocity is limited by $v$ \cite{Calabrese2006}. The propagation velocity, $v$, different than the sound velocity of the system for curved dispersion relations \cite{Lauchli2008}, whereby it is referred to as the \textit{Lieb-Robinson velocity}.

\label{fig:LightCone}
\end{figure}

Experimental evidence of an effective light-cone in a one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard system was shown in \cite{Cheneau2012}. In the experiment a Mott-insulating ground state was quenched to near the critical point as shown in figure \ref{fig:LightCone}(a). The initial ground state was thereby highly excited and acted as source for quasi-particles consisting of \textit{dublons} (excess particle) and \textit{holons} (hole) shown in figure \ref{fig:LightCone}(b). By measuring the two-point parity correlation function, the spreading of information through the system was shown to propagate at a constant velocity limited by the Lieb-Robinson bound.

To illustrate the propagation of correlation-mediating quasi-particles the evolution of an impurity in a simple Hubbard model was examined. Consider a Hubbard Hamiltonian of the form
\begin{equation}
	\hat{H} = - J \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \hat{a}_{i}^{\dag} \hat{a}_{j} \; ,
	\label{eq:simpleHubbardModel}
\end{equation} 
which contains no interactions. A quasi-particle excitation may not have strong interactions with the remaining system, although they may mutually interact. Here a single particle is considered, whereby a negligible  interaction is a reasonable approximation. Meanwhile, the quasi-particle will be experiencing the same lattice potential and any underlying harmonic confinement, if it remains in the lowest band. Here, a flat lattice (no underlying potential) is considered. Thus, the model described is equivalent to a quasi-particle excitation on top of a homogeneous Mott-insualator.
Figure \ref{fig:LightCone}(c) shows the density evolution of a single impurity, $\ket{1}_{0}$, initially placed at the central cite in a lattice of size $L = 61$. The resulting density wave is very reminiscent of a light/cone, as the probability velocity is bounded by a constant. Further examining the emerging cone, one will notice an exponentially suppressed population just outside the cone (more visible near the boundary). Due to the open boundaries of the system, the quasi-particle is reflected at the edge of the lattice, causing it to interfere with itself \cite{Calabrese2006}.\\
It should be stressed that the density wave shown in figure \ref{fig:LightCone} is not light-cone but merely the propagation of a single quasi-particle-like impurity. In a physical system quasi-particles will emerge at all sites, whereby the Lieb-Robinson velocity is different from the spreading velocity of non-interacting particles. In fact, the experimental investigation of light-cones in the Bose-Hubbard model found information velocities much higher than single-particle spreading velocities, yet lower than the Lieb-Robinson bound \cite{Cheneau2012}. While the simple Hubbard model illustrates the propagation of a single quasi-particle, the propagation of information within a many-body system is a many-body effect itself. \\

Due to the breakdown of adiabaticity around the critical point, it is inevitable that quasi-particle excitations will be created when transitioning from a superfluid to a Mott-insulator. Furthermore, a study of the Mott to superfluid phase transition showed that the propagation of correlations was well described for fast ramp sequences by ballistically spreading quasi-particles following the Lieb-Robinson bounds, while slower ramps required the interaction of quasi-particles to be considered \cite{Braun2015}. Therefore, engineering a lattice ramping sequence bringing the system from a superfluid to a Mott-Insulating ground state is a highly difficult task. While classical approaches fail to capture the rich dynamics of the phase transition, simulations of the system can be performed through tensor network methods, which provide a low-entanglement effective theory \cite{Gillman2018}. Although the low-entanglement approximation inevitably fails for long durations, the finite spreading velocity of correlations within the system enables the use of tensor-network methods for simulating dynamics for short durations \cite{Eisert2015}.
