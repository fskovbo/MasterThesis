\chapter{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
\item
cold atoms toolbox, controllability 

\item
optical lattices, quantum simulations, Mott as platform for many experiments

\item
many setups/experiments require low temperature/few defects, slow experiments vulnerable to decoherence and heating -> state preparation and dynamical control is important and made hard by phase transition

\item
optimal control is framework for manipulation of systems and expressing above problem as a minimization problem

\item 
simulating many-body systems is exponentially expensive -> tensor networks 

\item
this thesis presents a general framework for optimizing state transfers in lattice systems. The framework combines GROUP control, tensor networks, and interior point methods. Framework tested on non-integrable Bose-Hubbard model
