In this thesis, a framework for optimizing dynamics in quantum many-body lattice-system is presented. The framework addresses the extreme resource consumption and constraint enforcement associated with optimal control in such complex systems. This is realized through a combination of tensor networks, efficient parameterizations, and interior point methods. To validate the performance of the framework, its efficiency in finding optimal state transfers between the superfluid and Mott-insulator phase of the Bose-Hubbard model is compared to previous methods from literature. Here, the framework outperforms standard methods both in terms of obtained fidelity and convergence rate when applied to a small system. Lastly, an analysis of non-equilibrium dynamics in larger systems is conducted in order to gauge the proper setting of the framework needed large-scale applications.
