I would like to thank the people who enabled me to write this thesis. 
First, thanks to Jacob Sherson for welcoming me into the QMM-group providing me with the resources and insight necessary for completing the project. Furthermore, his engagement in activities outside work and his patience with me, as I blew most of the groups CPU-hours on the university cluster, are greatly appreciated.
 
Next, many thanks are due to Jens Jakob S\o rensen, for his day-to-day supervision. Our countless discussions of problems emerging throughout the project have been indispensable for its success. 
I would also like to thank Florian Korsakissok for channeling his dark linux magic, when my code failed compiling on the university cluster. 
Next, a thank you to Maja Juhl and Julie Kryger for providing me with exact diagonalization scripts for the Bose-Hubbard model. 
Additionally, I acknowledge the help from Miles Stoudenmire, lead developer of the ITensor library, for his technical support with regards to modifying preexisting methods in the library. 
Finally, I thank Emilie Hindbo, Emil "Dugge" Knudstrup, and S\o ren Sneftrup for being amazing office mates, without whom the long evenings and weekends at the university would have been horrible chore.
